# Java implementation of single-source and all-pairs shortest paths algorithms

**SSSP:** Dijkstra's and Parallel Dijktra's

**APSP:** Floyd-Warshall, Parallel Floyd-Warshall, APSP Dijkstra's, Seidel, Shoshan-Zwick (with corrections)

Running the test files for each algorithm will both check for correctness, and time the algorithm for varying graph sizes and number of threads.  

The results are discussed in Results.pdf
